# A beginner's guide to nftables

As the name suggests, this is a simple beginner's guide to nftables. **You can find prebuilt versions in various formats in the `build/` directory**.

This is still a work in progress, but I would appreciate any initial feedback on this project. 

## Build instructions

This project uses [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ "Sphinx Homepage") to build different documentation packages using [reStructuredText (reST)](https://docutils.readthedocs.io/en/sphinx-docs/user/rst/quickstart.html "A reStructuredText Primer"). If you want to build your own version from the reST sources, you will need sphinx. If you already have sphinx installed, it should be as simple as 

- `git clone https://github.com/bytepool/nft_beginners_guide.git nft_bg`
- `cd nft_bg`
- `make $target`

where `$target` is one of `{html, pdf}`
